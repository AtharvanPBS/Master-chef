1. Peel and chop potatoes in 2 cm cubes or 1 inch cubes. Place them in a bowl of water for 20 to 30 minutes. The potatoes should be completely immersed in the water.
2. Heat a heavy thick bottomed pan or cast iron skillet or a heavy kadai. Add 2 tablespoons oil. For a slight pungent taste you can use mustard oil. I have used peanut oil. If using mustard oil, then heat till the mustard oil starts smoking.
3. Now drain the potatoes and then add them.
4. Mix them very well with the oil and spread them evenly in the pan.
5. Keep on stirring after a few minutes and overall saute for 7 to 8 minutes, till the potatoes are half cooked on a low to medium-low flame.
6. Then add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder, ½ teaspoon coriander powder, ½ teaspoon cumin powder, a pinch of asafoetida (optional) and salt as per taste.
8. Spread them evenly in the pan.
9. Continue to stir often and cook till the potatoes are done. At each stir, change the position of potatoes so that they get crisp evenly from all sides.
10. Lastly add ¼ teaspoon garam masala powder and ½ teaspoon amchur powder (dry mango powder). Instead of amchur powder, you can also add lemon juice.
11. Mix very well and then switch off the flame.
12. Serve potato fry with chapati or roti or as a side dish with dal-rice or sambar-rice combo. You can garnish with some chopped coriander leaves if you want.s
